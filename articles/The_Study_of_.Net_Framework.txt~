What is the .NET Framework?
1 The .NET framework is a managed execution environment
2 The .NET framework consists of two major components:
  2.1 the common language runtime(CLR), which is the execution engine that 
    handles running applications;
  2.2 the .NET Framework Class Library, which provides a library of tested,
    reusable code that developers can call from their own applications.
3 The .NET framework provides a variety of services to its running applications
  3.1 Memory management
  3.2 A common type system
  3.3 An extensive class library(FCL)
  3.4 Applied frameworks and technologies(e.g., ASP.NET, ADO.NET...)
  3.5 Language interoperability

Overview of the .NET Framework
4 Features of the Common Language Runtime
  4.1 The common language runtime manages memory, thread execution, code
    execution, code safety verification, compilation, and other system
    services. These features are intrinsic to the managed code that runs
    on the common language runtime.
  4.2 The runtime enforces code access security.
  4.3 The runtime enforces code robustness by implementing a strict type-and-
    code-verification infrastructure called the common type system(CTS). The
    CTS ensures that all managed code is self-describing.
  4.4 Interoperability between managed and unmanaged code enables developers to
    continue to use necessary COM components and DLLs.
  4.5 The runtime is designed to enhance performance. A feature called just-
    in-time(JIT) compiling enables all managed code to run in the native 
    machine language of the system on which it is executing. Meanwhile, the
    memory manager removes the possibilities of fragmented memory and increase
    memory locality-of-reference to further increase performance. 
5 .NET Framework Class Library
  5.1 The .NET Framework class library is a collection of reuseable types that
    tightly integrate with the common language runtime. The class library is 
    object oriented, providing types from which your own managed code can de-
    rive functionality.
